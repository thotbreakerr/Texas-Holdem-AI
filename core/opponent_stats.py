"""
core/opponent_stats.py — Per-opponent stat tracker
--------------------------------------------------
Modeled on bots/exploitative_bot.py's tracker, but with two output
methods so Path A and Path B can both consume the same source.

Path A uses bucket() for a 4-category label in the info-set key.
Path B uses to_tensor() for a fixed-shape feature vector.

This gate provides the class only. Wiring observe_action into the
engine is a Gate 2 task per path.

Both Path A and Path B import from here. This module is read-only
after Gate 1 closes.
